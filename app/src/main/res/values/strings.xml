    <string name="faq_1_title">Why does the app require access to the internet?</string>
    <string name="faq_1_text">Sadly it is needed for sending MMS attachments. Not being able to send MMS would be a really huge disadvantage compared to other apps, so we decided to go this way.
    However, as usually, there are no ads, tracking or analytics whatsoever, the internet is used only for sending MMS.</string>
